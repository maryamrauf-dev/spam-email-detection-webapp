##  Project Overview

This project is a high-performance **Spam Email Detection System** developed as part of my internship at **NovaXccelerate**. It leverages advanced Machine Learning techniques to differentiate between "Spam" and "Ham" (legitimate) messages with high precision.

The application features a modern, cyberpunk-inspired UI built with **Streamlit**, providing users with a seamless experience for both individual message analysis and batch processing via CSV uploads.

---

##  Key Features

-   ** Real-Time Analysis:** Instantly classify any email or SMS content as Spam or Ham using AI.
-   ** Batch Processing:** Upload a CSV file containing multiple messages and get a detailed classification report in seconds.
-   ** Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** A premium, dark-themed UI with glow effects and responsive components.
-   ** Scan History:** Keep track of your recent scans with a convenient history sidebar.
-   ** AI Confidence Scoring:** View the statistical confidence level of each prediction to understand the model's certainty.
-   ** Intelligent Initializer:** Automatically trains and optimizes the model on the first run using local datasets.

---

## Technical Architecture

### The Model
The core intelligence is powered by a **Logistic Regression** classifier, optimized with:
-   **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts raw text into numerical features while emphasizing unique keywords.
-   **Balanced Class Weights:** Specifically tuned to handle the native imbalance between spam and ham messages.
-   **Scikit-Learn Pipeline:** Ensures consistency between training and inference phases.

### Tech Stack
-   **Frontend:** Streamlit (with Custom CSS/HTML Injection for premium UI)
-   **Backend:** Python 3.x
-   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
-   **Data Storage:** Local CSV integration for efficient processing

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classifier.git
    cd "spam email detection internship project"
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

## How to Use

1.  **Manual Check:** Paste your email content into the main text area and click **"VERIFY INTEGRITY"**.
2.  **Batch Check:** Use the sidebar to upload a CSV file (ensure it has a column named `Message` or `text`).
3.  **Review History:** Check the sidebar to see your previous scan results and their confidence levels.
